## To Do

- Check for post-1999 changes
- Check map boundaries against original source info, including these removals (still in src folder as geojson files):
removed 1971-SMSA (same as 1963-SMSA)
removed 1981-SMSA (same as 1973-SMSA), but give its color to 1973-SMSA
removed 1990-PMSA (same as 1983-PMSA), but give its color to 1983-PMSA
removed 1999-MSA (same as 1999-MSA)
