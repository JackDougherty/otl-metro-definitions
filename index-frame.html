    <iframe src="index.html" width="100%" height=500></iframe>
    <p>The US Census Bureau's definition of the Hartford metropolitan area expanded from 1950 (red) to today (blue) as the suburbs grew in population. Also, the Census relabeled its boundaries from Standard Metropolitan Area (SMA, in 1950) to Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA, in 1960), to Primary Statistical Metropolitan Area (PMSA, in 1983), to Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA, in 1993).
